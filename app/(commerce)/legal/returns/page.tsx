            <h2>2. How to Initiate a Return</h2>
            <p>To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:concierge@aethelon.com">concierge@aethelon.com</a> or use our Returns Portal in your account dashboard.</p>

            <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
            <p>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business days.</p>
